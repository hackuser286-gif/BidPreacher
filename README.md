# BidPreacher

A zero-cost, static, connector e-commerce storefront.  
🚫 No payments or inventory online — instead, **Buy Now** requests are forwarded instantly to the site owner via WhatsApp or Email. The owner then connects the buyer with the seller offline.

Hosted free on **GitHub Pages**. Built with **HTML + CSS + vanilla JS** only.
